<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>In early 2021, Danny follows his passion for Japanese food and opens "Danny's Diner," a charming restaurant offering sushi, curry, and ramen. However, lacking data analysis expertise, the restaurant struggles to leverage the basic data collected during its initial months to make informed business decisions. Danny's Diner seeks assistance in using this data effectively to keep the restaurant thriving.</p>

<h1><a name="problemstatement">Problem Statement</a></h1>
<p>Danny aims to utilize customer data to gain valuable insights into their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. By establishing a deeper connection with his customers, he can provide a more personalized experience for his loyal patrons.

He plans to use these insights to make informed decisions about expanding the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, Danny seeks assistance in generating basic datasets for his team to inspect the data conveniently, without requiring SQL expertise.

Due to privacy concerns, he has shared a sample of his overall customer data, hoping it will be sufficient for you to create fully functional SQL queries to address his questions.

The case study revolves around three key datasets:

- Sales
- Menu
- Members</p>

  <li><h5>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</h5></li>
	
```sql
SELECT S.customer_id, SUM(M.price) AS total_amnt
FROM sales S
JOIN menu M ON S.product_id = M.product_id
GROUP BY S.customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
```

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D1.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the total amount spent (<code>total_amnt</code>) by each customer at the restaurant.</li>
  <li>It combines data from the <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The query then calculates the total sum of <code>price</code> for each group of sales records with the same <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
</ul>



  <li><h5>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</h5></li>

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS No_Days
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
```
<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D2.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and counts the number of distinct order dates (<code>No_Days</code>) for each customer.</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)</code> function calculates the number of unique order dates for each customer.</li>
  <li>Finally, the query presents the total number of unique order dates as <code>No_Days</code> for each customer.</li>
</ul>



  <li><h5>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</h5></li>

```sql
WITH CTE AS
(SELECT S.customer_id,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY S.customer_id ORDER BY S.order_date)AS rn,M.product_name
FROM sales S
JOIN menu M ON S.product_id=M.product_id)

SELECT customer_id,product_name
FROM CTE
WHERE rn=1
```

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D3.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>CTE</code> to generate a temporary result set.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, it selects the <code>customer_id</code>, assigns a dense rank to each row based on the order date for each customer, and retrieves the corresponding <code>product_name</code> from the <code>menu</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>sales</code> table is joined with the <code>menu</code> table on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a rank to each row within the partition of each <code>customer_id</code> based on the <code>order_date</code> in ascending order.</li>
  <li>Each <code>customer_id</code> has its own partition and separate ranks based on the order dates of their purchases.</li>
  <li>Next, the main query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and corresponding <code>product_name</code> from the CTE.</li>
  <li>It filters the results and only includes rows where the rank <code>rn</code> is equal to 1, which means the earliest purchase for each <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query returns the first purchased product for each customer.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</h5></li>

```sql
SELECT M.product_name,COUNT(S.product_id)AS most_ordered
FROM Sales S
JOIN menu M ON S.product_id=M.product_id
GROUP BY M.product_name
ORDER BY most_ordered DESC
LIMIT 1
```

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D4.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>product_name</code> from the <code>menu</code> table and counts the number of times each product was ordered (<code>most_ordered</code>).</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>Sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>menu</code> table based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>product_name</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(S.product_id)</code> function calculates the number of occurrences of each <code>product_id</code> in the <code>Sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The query then presents the <code>product_name</code> and its corresponding count as <code>most_ordered</code> for each product.</li>
  <li>Next, the results are sorted in descending order based on the <code>most_ordered</code> column, so the most ordered product appears first.</li>
  <li>The <code>LIMIT 1</code> clause is used to restrict the result to only one row, effectively showing the most ordered product.</li>
</ul>



  <li><h5>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</h5></li>

```sql
WITH CTE AS
(SELECT S.customer_id,M.product_name,COUNT(M.product_id)AS order_count,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY S.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(S.product_id)DESC) AS rnk
FROM sales S
JOIN menu M ON S.product_id=M.product_id
GROUP BY S.customer_id,M.product_name)

SELECT customer_id,product_name,order_count
FROM CTE
WHERE rnk=1
```

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D5.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>CTE</code> to generate a temporary result set.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, it selects the <code>customer_id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, and counts the number of times each product was ordered (<code>order_count</code>) for each customer.</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>menu</code> table based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code> and <code>product_name</code> to get the count of orders for each product of each customer.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(M.product_id)</code> function calculates the number of occurrences of each <code>product_id</code> in the <code>menu</code> table.</li>
  <li>The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a rank to each row within the partition of each <code>customer_id</code> based on the order count of products in descending order.</li>
  <li>Each <code>customer_id</code> has its own partition and separate ranks based on the number of product orders.</li>
  <li>Next, the main query selects the <code>customer_id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, and <code>order_count</code> from the CTE.</li>
  <li>It filters the results and only includes rows where the rank <code>rnk</code> is equal to 1, which means the most ordered product for each <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query returns the customer's ID, the most ordered product, and the number of times it was ordered by that customer.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</h5></li>

  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (s.customer_id)
       s.customer_id,
       m.product_name
FROM sales s
JOIN members mbr ON s.customer_id = mbr.customer_id
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date > mbr.join_date
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D6.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves distinct rows for each unique <code>customer_id</code> with their corresponding <code>product_name</code> from the <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables.</li>
  <li>It filters the data based on the condition that the <code>order_date</code> in the <code>sales</code> table is greater than the <code>join_date</code> of the customer in the <code>members</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>sales</code> table is aliased as <code>s</code>, the <code>members</code> table is aliased as <code>mbr</code>, and the <code>menu</code> table is aliased as <code>m</code>.</li>
  <li>The query performs inner joins between <code>sales</code> and <code>members</code> tables on matching <code>customer_id</code> and between <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>Only rows that meet the join condition and the <code>order_date > join_date</code> condition are considered in the result set.</li>
  <li>The query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and corresponding <code>product_name</code> for each customer who has placed an order after their <code>join_date</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are sorted in ascending order based on the <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>DISTINCT ON (s.customer_id)</code> clause ensures that only the first occurrence of each <code>customer_id</code> is included in the result set.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query returns a unique list of <code>customer_id</code> along with the first <code>product_name</code> they ordered after joining as a member.</li>

<h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="D9.png">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the total points (<code>total_points</code>) earned by each customer based on their purchases from the <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables.</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>menu</code> table based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query starts by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>dates_cte</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, it selects <code>customer_id</code>, <code>join_date</code>, <code>join_date + INTERVAL '6 days'</code> as <code>valid_date</code>, and the last day of the month for the date '2021-01-31' as <code>last_date</code>.</li>
  <li>The CTE is used to generate date ranges for each customer, from their <code>join_date</code> to 6 days later, and the last day of the month for January 2021.</li>
  <li>Next, the main query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the total points (<code>points</code>) earned by each customer based on their purchases from the <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables.</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>dates_cte</code> CTE using a combination of <code>JOIN</code> and <code>ON</code> clauses.</li>
