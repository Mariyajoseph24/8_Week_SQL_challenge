  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the week number of the year from the <code>registration_date</code> column in the <code>runners</code> table and the count of signed-up runners for each week (<code>signed_runner_week</code>).</li>
  <li>It uses the <code>to_char</code> function to convert the <code>registration_date</code> to a text representation of the week number of the year (<code>'ww'</code>).</li>
  <li>The <code>::date</code> cast is used to convert the <code>registration_date</code> from a timestamp to a date data type before extracting the week number.</li>
  <li>Results are grouped by the week number of the year to calculate the count of signed-up runners for each week.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(runner_id)</code> function calculates the number of occurrences of each <code>runner_id</code> in the <code>runners</code> table, giving the count of signed-up runners for each week.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the week number of the year as <code>weeks</code> and the corresponding count of signed-up runners as <code>signed_runner_week</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the week number of the year.</li>
</ul>

  
   <li><h5>What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pick up the order?</h5></li>

   ```sql
WITH CTE as (

    c.order_time, 
    r.pickup_time, EXTRACT(minutes FROM pickup_time - order_time) AS Subst
		FROM runner_orders_temp R
		JOIN customer_orders_tempp C
		USING (order_id)
		WHERE cancellation=''
		GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time

SELECT AVG(Subst)::INT AS pickup_avg

   <ul>
  <li>The SQL query starts by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>CTE</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, it retrieves the <code>order_id</code>, <code>order_time</code>, <code>pickup_time</code>, and calculates the time difference in minutes (<code>Subst</code>) between the <code>pickup_time</code> and <code>order_time</code> for each order from the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> and <code>customer_orders_tempp</code> tables.</li>
  <li>It performs an inner join between the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> table and the <code>customer_orders_tempp</code> table on matching <code>order_id</code> to get the order and pickup time information.</li>
  <li>The query filters the data using the <code>WHERE</code> clause, selecting only the rows where the cancellation column (<code>cancellation</code>) in the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> table is empty (i.e., no cancellation).</li>
  <li>Results are grouped by <code>order_id</code>, <code>order_time</code>, and <code>pickup_time</code> to calculate the time difference (<code>Subst</code>) for each order.</li>
  <li>The <code>EXTRACT(minutes FROM pickup_time - order_time)</code> expression calculates the time difference in minutes between the <code>pickup_time</code> and <code>order_time</code> for each order.</li>
  <li>Next, the main query retrieves the integer value of the average of all <code>Subst</code> values greater than 1 from the <code>CTE</code> CTE.</li>
  <li>The <code>AVG(Subst)::INT</code> expression calculates the average of all <code>Subst</code> values in the CTE and then converts it to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest integer.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE Subst > 1</code> clause filters out any time differences that are less than or equal to 1 minute.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the integer value of the average pickup time for all orders with pickup times more than 1 minute after the order times from the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> and <code>customer_orders_tempp</code> tables, excluding any orders with cancellations.</li>
</ul>
   
   <li><h5>Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?</h5></li>

```sql
  WITH CTE AS
(SELECT c.order_id, 
    COUNT(C.order_id) AS pizza_order, 
    C.order_time, 
    R.pickup_time,EXTRACT(minutes FROM pickup_time - order_time) AS min
	  
FROM customer_orders_tempp C
JOIN runner_orders_temp R
USING(order_id)
WHERE cancellation=''
GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time)

SELECT 
  pizza_order, 
  ROUND(AVG(min),2) AS avg_prep_time_minutes
FROM CTE
WHERE min > 1
GROUP BY pizza_order;

   <ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the rounded average distance traveled for each customer (<code>average</code>) from the <code>customer_orders_tempp</code> and <code>runner_orders_temp</code> tables.</li>
  <li>It performs an inner join between the <code>customer_orders_tempp</code> table and the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> table on matching <code>order_id</code> to get the order and delivery information.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the longest delivery duration (<code>long_delivery</code>), shortest delivery duration (<code>shortest_delivery</code>), and the difference between the longest and shortest durations (<code>difference</code>) from the <code>runner_orders_temp</code> table.</li>
