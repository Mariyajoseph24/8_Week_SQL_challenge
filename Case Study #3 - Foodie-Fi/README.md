<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>In response to the growing popularity of subscription-based businesses, Danny recognized a significant market gap. He saw an opportunity to introduce a distinctive streaming service, one that exclusively featured culinary contentâ€”a culinary counterpart to platforms like Netflix. With this vision in mind, Danny collaborated with a group of astute friends to establish Foodie-Fi, a startup launched in 2020. The company quickly began offering monthly and annual subscription plans, granting subscribers unrestricted access to an array of exclusive culinary videos sourced from across the globe.

At the heart of Foodie-Fi's foundation lies Danny's commitment to data-driven decision-making. He was resolute in leveraging data to inform all future investments and innovative features. This case study delves into the realm of subscription-style digital data, where insights derived from data analysis are pivotal in addressing critical business inquiries and steering the company toward sustained growth and success.</p>

  <img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/c5d03554-ff58-44c0-96cf-dd13ed9483b4">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the count of distinct <code>customer_id</code> values from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)</code> function calculates the number of unique <code>customer_id</code> values in the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the total number of unique customers who have subscriptions in the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value</h5></li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves data related to trial subscriptions from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>DATE_TRUNC</code> function is used to truncate the <code>start_date</code> column to the start of each month, resulting in the <code>month_start</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(*)</code> function calculates the number of records (trial starts) in the <code>subscriptions</code> table for each truncated month.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE plan_id = 0</code> condition filters the data to include only trial subscriptions, where the <code>plan_id</code> is 0.</li>
  <li>Results are grouped by the <code>month_start</code> column, which represents the start of each month after truncation.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY month_start</code> clause arranges the results in ascending order based on the <code>month_start</code> column.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the truncated start of each month and the corresponding count of trial subscription starts for that month from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves data related to subscription events from the <code>subscriptions</code> table and their corresponding plan details from the <code>plans</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement selects the <code>plan_name</code>, <code>plan_id</code>, and the count of records (subscription events) as <code>event_count</code> from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>JOIN</code> clause connects the <code>subscriptions</code> table with the <code>plans</code> table using the common <code>plan_id</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE s.start_date > '2020-12-31'</code> condition filters the data to include only records with start dates after December 31, 2020.</li>
  <li>Results are grouped by the <code>plan_name</code> and <code>plan_id</code> columns from the <code>plans</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY p.plan_name, p.plan_id</code> clause arranges the results in ascending order based on the <code>plan_name</code> and <code>plan_id</code> columns.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the plan name, plan ID, and the corresponding count of subscription events for each plan that started after December 31, 2020, using data from the <code>subscriptions</code> and <code>plans</code> tables.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the count and percentage of churned customers based on certain conditions from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>
  <li>The first <code>COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ... END)</code> expression calculates the count of distinct customer IDs who have a plan ID of 4 and started their subscription on or before the current date. This count represents the churned customers.</li>
  <li>The second <code>ROUND(...)</code> expression calculates the churned percentage by dividing the count of churned customers by the count of distinct customer IDs and then multiplying by 100.0. The <code>ROUND</code> function rounds the result to one decimal place.</li>
  <li>The <code>FROM subscriptions s</code> clause specifies that the data is being retrieved from the <code>subscriptions</code> table with the alias <code>s</code>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the count of churned customers (those with plan ID 4 and a start date on or before the current date) and the corresponding percentage of churned customers in relation to all distinct customers from the <code>subscriptions</code> table.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates customer payments for various subscription plans during the year 2020 based on data from the <code>subscriptions</code> and <code>plans</code> tables.</li>
  <li>The <code>all_plans</code> Common Table Expression (CTE) is defined to retrieve customer details, plan details, start dates, prices, and payment dates based on subscription data.</li>
  <li>Within the <code>all_plans</code> CTE, a conditional expression calculates the payment date based on the plan type (monthly or annual) and ensures that payments for annual plans are made in December.</li>
  <li>The <code>payments</code> CTE is defined to calculate individual payment records based on customer, plan, and payment date.</li>
  <li>Within the <code>payments</code> CTE, the <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> function assigns a payment order to each record within the same customer, plan, plan name, and payment date partition.</li>
  <li>The main query selects the finalized customer payment details, including customer ID, plan ID, plan name, payment date, amount, and payment order.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE payment_order = 1 OR (amount > 0 AND payment_order > 1)</code> condition filters the data to include the first payment for each partition and subsequent payments with a positive amount.</li>
  <li>The query <code>ORDER BY customer_id, plan_id, payment_date, payment_order</code> arranges the results in ascending order based on customer ID, plan ID, payment date, and payment order.</li>
  <li>The <code>LIMIT 20</code> clause limits the results to the first 20 records.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the customer payments for various subscription plans during the year 2020, including the customer ID, plan ID, plan name, payment date, amount, and payment order.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
