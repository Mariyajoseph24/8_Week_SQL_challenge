<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to an enthralling journey into the world of finance, innovation, and data convergence. In this captivating case study project, we immerse ourselves in the realm of Neo-Banks, the trailblazing digital financial entities revolutionizing the industry landscape by eliminating physical branches. Our focus zooms in on an ingenious visionary named Danny, whose aspirations transcend the ordinary, leading to the inception of a remarkable initiative ‚Äì "Data Bank."<br>

Within the fabric of this narrative lies a compelling fusion of Neo-Banking, cryptocurrency, and cutting-edge data management. The birth of Data Bank signifies a paradigm shift where the contours of digital banking intertwine seamlessly with the frontiers of secure distributed data storage.<br>

The essence of Data Bank mirrors that of traditional digital banks, albeit with an unprecedented twist. Not confined merely to financial transactions, this avant-garde establishment boasts the accolade of harboring the world's most impregnable distributed data storage platform. As we delve deeper, a unique interplay emerges ‚Äì customers' cloud data storage allotments are intricately tied to their financial standing. Yet, the intricacies of this symbiotic relationship beckon us to explore further.<br>

Our protagonist, Data Bank, has set its sights on twin goals: expanding its customer base and, concurrently, gaining insights to navigate the data storage landscape. It is in this intricate tapestry of aspirations that we invite you, the analytical trailblazers, to join hands with the Data Bank team.<br>

This case study project is an expedition into the realms of metric calculation, growth strategy formulation, and incisive data-driven insights. As collaborators in this journey, we wield the tools of analysis to forecast and shape future developments. The canvas before us is one of intricate calculation, strategic expansion, and data-driven foresight. Embark on this expedition as we decipher the chronicles of Data Bank's evolution, where innovation intersects with pragmatism, and where data illuminates the path forward.</p>

  <li>Within the main query, the <code>LAG</code> window function is used to retrieve the previous month's closing balance for each customer.</li>
  <li>The calculated <code>closing_balance_increase</code> represents the percentage increase in closing balance for each month, considering the previous month's balance.</li>
  <li>The <code>FILTER</code> condition filters the results to consider only rows where <code>closing_balance_increase</code> is greater than 5%.</li>
  <li>The main query then calculates the percentage of customers with a closing balance increase greater than 5% by dividing the count of such customers by the total count of customers and multiplying by 100.</li>
  <li>The <code>ROUND</code> function is used to round the percentage to two decimal places.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the percentage increase in closing balances for customers with an increase greater than 5% based on monthly transaction data.</li>
