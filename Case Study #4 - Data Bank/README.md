<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to an enthralling journey into the world of finance, innovation, and data convergence. In this captivating case study project, we immerse ourselves in the realm of Neo-Banks, the trailblazing digital financial entities revolutionizing the industry landscape by eliminating physical branches. Our focus zooms in on an ingenious visionary named Danny, whose aspirations transcend the ordinary, leading to the inception of a remarkable initiative ‚Äì "Data Bank."<br>

Within the fabric of this narrative lies a compelling fusion of Neo-Banking, cryptocurrency, and cutting-edge data management. The birth of Data Bank signifies a paradigm shift where the contours of digital banking intertwine seamlessly with the frontiers of secure distributed data storage.<br>

The essence of Data Bank mirrors that of traditional digital banks, albeit with an unprecedented twist. Not confined merely to financial transactions, this avant-garde establishment boasts the accolade of harboring the world's most impregnable distributed data storage platform. As we delve deeper, a unique interplay emerges ‚Äì customers' cloud data storage allotments are intricately tied to their financial standing. Yet, the intricacies of this symbiotic relationship beckon us to explore further.<br>

Our protagonist, Data Bank, has set its sights on twin goals: expanding its customer base and, concurrently, gaining insights to navigate the data storage landscape. It is in this intricate tapestry of aspirations that we invite you, the analytical trailblazers, to join hands with the Data Bank team.<br>

This case study project is an expedition into the realms of metric calculation, growth strategy formulation, and incisive data-driven insights. As collaborators in this journey, we wield the tools of analysis to forecast and shape future developments. The canvas before us is one of intricate calculation, strategic expansion, and data-driven foresight. Embark on this expedition as we decipher the chronicles of Data Bank's evolution, where innovation intersects with pragmatism, and where data illuminates the path forward.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the count of customers per region from the <code>regions</code> and <code>customer_nodes</code> tables.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement selects the <code>region_name</code> and the count of distinct <code>customer_id</code> values for each region.</li>
  <li>The <code>LEFT JOIN</code> clause joins the <code>regions</code> table with the <code>customer_nodes</code> table using the <code>region_id</code> as the common column.</li>

  <li><h5>How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?</h5></li>

  ```sql
WITH CTE AS
(SELECT customer_id, 
    node_id,
    end_date - start_date AS node_dys
FROM customer_nodes

  GROUP BY customer_id, node_id, start_date, end_date),
  
CTE2 AS
(
  SELECT customer_id,node_id,
    SUM(node_dys) AS total_node
  FROM CTE

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average total number of days that each customer-node combination was active, based on data from the <code>customer_nodes</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>CTE</code> (Common Table Expression) named <code>CTE</code> is defined to calculate the number of days each customer-node combination was active. It calculates the difference between the <code>end_date</code> and <code>start_date</code> columns and renames it as <code>node_dys</code>. The <code>WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'</code> condition filters out records with the default end date.</li>
  <li>The <code>CTE2</code> is defined to calculate the total number of days each customer-node combination was active. It sums the <code>node_dys</code> values for each customer-node combination using the <code>SUM(node_dys)</code> function.</li>
  <li>The main query calculates the rounded average of the <code>total_node</code> values using the <code>AVG(total_node)</code> function and renames it as <code>avg_n</code>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the rounded average total number of days that each customer-node combination was active, based on the data from the <code>CTE2</code> and <code>customer_nodes</code> tables.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?</h5></li>

        customer_nodes cn
    WHERE
        end_date != '9999-12-31'
)
SELECT
    r.region_name,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys) AS median,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys) AS percentile_80,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys) AS percentile_95
FROM
    date_diff_cte d
JOIN
    regions r ON d.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY
    r.region_name;
```

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates statistical percentiles of node active durations for each region based on data from the <code>customer_nodes</code> and <code>regions</code> tables.</li>
  <li>The <code>WITH</code> clause defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>date_diff_cte</code> that calculates the difference in days between <code>end_date</code> and <code>start_date</code> for each active node. The condition <code>end_date != '9999-12-31'</code> filters out records with the default end date.</li>
  <li>The main query selects the <code>region_name</code> column from the <code>regions</code> table and calculates the statistical percentiles within groups of node active durations for each region.</li>
  <li>The <code>PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys)</code> calculates the median, <code>PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys)</code> calculates the 80th percentile, and <code>PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY node_dys)</code> calculates the 95th percentile of node active durations for each region.</li>
  <li>The <code>JOIN</code> clause joins the <code>date_diff_cte</code> CTE with the <code>regions</code> table using the <code>region_id</code> as the common column.</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY r.region_name</code> groups the results by <code>region_name</code> to present the statistical percentiles of node active durations for each region.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query presents the region names along with the median, 80th percentile, and 95th percentile of node active durations, calculated using data from the <code>date_diff_cte</code> CTE and the <code>regions</code> table.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
