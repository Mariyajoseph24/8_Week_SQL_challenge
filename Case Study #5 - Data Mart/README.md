<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>In the focal point of our case study is Danny's latest enterprise, Data Mart, which emerges following his successful oversight of global operations for an online grocery store specializing in fresh produce. Danny now seeks our collaboration to dissect his sales performance analysis.<br>

In the juncture of June 2020, Data Mart underwent significant supply chain modifications. Embracing sustainability, the company transitioned all its products to employ eco-friendly packaging throughout the entire journey from the farm to the end consumer.<br>

Danny is enlisting our expertise to quantify the ramifications of this alteration on Data Mart's sales performance across its distinct business sectors.<br>

Central to this inquiry are the subsequent pivotal questions:<br>
<ul>
<li>What is the measurable impact resulting from the changes implemented in June 2020?</li><br>
<li>Among platforms, regions, segments, and customer categories, which experienced the most pronounced effects due to these adjustments?</li><br>
<li>How can we strategize for potential future implementations of analogous sustainability enhancements to the business, with the aim of mitigating any adverse consequences on sales?</li><br></p>

<ol> 
  <li><h5>

<p>In a single query, the following operations are performed to generate a new table named <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> in the <code>data_mart</code> schema:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert the <code>week_date</code> to a <code>DATE</code> format</li>
  <li>Add a <code>week_number</code> as the second column for each <code>week_date</code> value, where the week number corresponds to the range of dates within that week</li>
  <li>Add a <code>month_number</code> with the calendar month for each <code>week_date</code> value as the third column</li>
  <li>Add a <code>calendar_year</code> column as the fourth column containing values of 2018, 2019, or 2020 based on the year of the <code>week_date</code></li>
  <li>Add a new column called <code>age_band</code> after the original <code>segment</code> column using predefined mappings for age groups</li>
  <li>Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values</li>
  <li>Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns</li>
  <li>Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record</li>
</ul></h5></li>

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
CREATE TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS

<ul>
  <li>The SQL script begins by creating a new table named <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> by selecting and transforming data from an existing table named <code>weekly_sales</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the <code>SELECT</code> statement, various operations are performed on the <code>week_date</code> column to extract different date-related information like <code>week_number</code>, <code>month_number</code>, <code>transaction_month</code>, and <code>calendar_year</code> based on the year of the <code>week_date</code>.</li>
  <li>Using <code>CASE</code> statements, the <code>age_band</code> column is determined based on the last digit of the <code>segment</code> column.</li>
  <li>Similarly, the <code>demographic</code> column is determined based on the first letter of the <code>segment</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>COALESCE</code> function ensures that the <code>segment</code> column is replaced with 'unknown' if it's an empty string.</li>
  <li>Finally, the <code>transactions</code>, <code>sales</code>, and <code>avg_transaction</code> columns are calculated using appropriate formulas.</li>
  <li>After the transformation, the script selects all columns from the newly created <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>As a result, the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table contains transformed and cleaned data from the <code>weekly_sales</code> table with various columns representing date information, age band, demographic, platform, sales metrics, and more.</li>

  <li><h5>What day of the week is used for each week_date value?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(TO_CHAR(week_date, 'day')) AS day

  <img width="100" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/7979aa79-bb6b-443b-b6b1-d6093575c289">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects distinct weekdays from the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>TO_CHAR</code> function is used to format the <code>week_date</code> column as a weekday string.</li>
  <li>The format 'day' specifies that only the name of the day of the week should be extracted.</li>
  <li>The result is a list of unique weekday names present in the <code>week_date</code> column of the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?</h5></li>

  ```sql

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query uses a common table expression (CTE) named <code>week_number_cte</code> to generate a series of week numbers from 1 to 52.</li>
  <li>The <code>GENERATE_SERIES</code> function is used to create a sequence of numbers within the specified range.</li>
  <li>The main <code>SELECT</code> statement then selects distinct <code>week_num</code> values from the <code>week_number_cte</code> CTE.</li>
  <li>A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is performed between the <code>week_number_cte</code> CTE and the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table on the condition that the <code>week_num</code> matches the <code>week_number</code> column in the sales data.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE</code> clause filters rows where the <code>week_number</code> in the sales data is <code>NULL</code>, indicating missing data for that week.</li>
  <li>The result is a list of week numbers that are missing data in the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The list is ordered in ascending order of week numbers.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?</h5></li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>calendar_year</code> and calculates the total number of transactions for each calendar year from the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM</code> function is used to add up the <code>transactions</code> values for each year.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by the <code>calendar_year</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause sorts the results in ascending order based on the <code>calendar_year</code>.</li>
  <li>The outcome is a list that displays the total number of transactions for each calendar year present in the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query first creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>monthly_platform_sales</code>.</li>
  <li>In the CTE, the query calculates the total monthly sales for each combination of <code>calendar_year</code>, <code>month_number</code>, and <code>platform</code> from the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table using the <code>SUM</code> function.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>calendar_year</code>, <code>month_number</code>, and <code>platform</code>.</li>
  <li>The main part of the query selects data from the <code>monthly_platform_sales</code> CTE.</li>
  <li>It calculates the percentage of retail sales by dividing the sum of monthly sales from the 'Retail' platform by the total monthly sales, multiplied by 100. The <code>ROUND</code> function is used to round the result to two decimal places.</li>
  <li>Similarly, it calculates the percentage of Shopify sales by dividing the sum of monthly sales from the 'Shopify' platform by the total monthly sales, multiplied by 100.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>calendar_year</code> and <code>month_number</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause sorts the results in ascending order based on <code>calendar_year</code> and <code>month_number</code>.</li>
  <li>The outcome is a table that displays the percentage of retail and Shopify sales for each month and calendar year based on the data from the <code>clean_weekly_sales</code> table.</li>

  <li><h5>This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
