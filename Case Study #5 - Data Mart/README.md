<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>In the focal point of our case study is Danny's latest enterprise, Data Mart, which emerges following his successful oversight of global operations for an online grocery store specializing in fresh produce. Danny now seeks our collaboration to dissect his sales performance analysis.<br>

In the juncture of June 2020, Data Mart underwent significant supply chain modifications. Embracing sustainability, the company transitioned all its products to employ eco-friendly packaging throughout the entire journey from the farm to the end consumer.<br>

Danny is enlisting our expertise to quantify the ramifications of this alteration on Data Mart's sales performance across its distinct business sectors.<br>

Central to this inquiry are the subsequent pivotal questions:<br>
<ul>
<li>What is the measurable impact resulting from the changes implemented in June 2020?</li><br>
<li>Among platforms, regions, segments, and customer categories, which experienced the most pronounced effects due to these adjustments?</li><br>
<li>How can we strategize for potential future implementations of analogous sustainability enhancements to the business, with the aim of mitigating any adverse consequences on sales?</li><br></p>
