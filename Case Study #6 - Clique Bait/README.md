<img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/f87f3815-7fd2-4cf5-b107-a02bd785f3a8">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the percentage of visits where the event type is equal to 3, indicating a purchase event.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN visit_id END)</code> counts the number of unique <code>visit_id</code>s where the <code>event_type</code> is 3 (purchase event).</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)</code> counts the total number of unique <code>visit_id</code>s in the <code>events</code> table.</li>
  <li>The calculation <code>(purchase_count * 100.0 / total_visits)</code> computes the percentage of purchase events among all visits.</li>
  <li>The output is a single column named <code>purchase_percentage</code> which represents the calculated percentage.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?</h5></li>

  ```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        visit_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout_viewed,
        MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_made
    FROM events
    GROUP BY visit_id
)

SELECT 
    ROUND(100 * (1 - (SUM(purchase_made)::numeric / SUM(checkout_viewed))), 2) AS percentagewithout_purchase
FROM CTE;
```
   <h6>Answer:</h6>
<img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/99ede866-1163-4874-954f-0f0094117b77">
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>CTE</code> to calculate specific event indicators for each <code>visit_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The CTE calculates two indicators for each visit: <code>checkout_viewed</code> and <code>purchase_made</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>checkout_viewed</code> indicator is calculated using the <code>MAX</code> function along with a <code>CASE</code> statement to identify visits where <code>event_type</code> is 1 (page view) and <code>page_id</code> is 12 (indicating a checkout page view).</li>
  <li>The <code>purchase_made</code> indicator is calculated similarly for visits where <code>event_type</code> is 3 (purchase event).</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY visit_id</code> groups the results by <code>visit_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The main query calculates the percentage of visits without a purchase by subtracting the sum of <code>purchase_made</code> from the sum of <code>checkout_viewed</code>.</li>
  <li>The expression <code>(1 - (SUM(purchase_made) / SUM(checkout_viewed)))</code> calculates the ratio of visits without a purchase.</li>
  <li>The query then multiplies the ratio by 100, rounds the result to two decimal places using the <code>ROUND</code> function, and presents it as <code>percentagewithout_purchase</code>.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What are the top 3 pages by number of views?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT page_id, COUNT(*) AS page_views

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves page views by counting the occurrences of each <code>page_id</code> with <code>event_type</code> equal to 1 (indicating a page view).</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE event_type = 1</code> clause filters the results to include only events of type 1 (page view).</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY page_id</code> groups the results by unique <code>page_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY page_views DESC</code> clause sorts the results in descending order based on the count of page views.</li>
  <li>The <code>LIMIT 3</code> limits the output to the top 3 <code>page_id</code> entries with the highest page views.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT ph.product_category,
       SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_views,
       SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_cart_adds

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves statistics for product categories from the <code>page_hierarchy</code> and <code>events</code> tables.</li>
  <li>The <code>LEFT JOIN</code> operation combines data from the <code>page_hierarchy</code> and <code>events</code> tables using the common <code>page_id</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)</code> expression calculates the total number of page views (event_type = 1) for each product category.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)</code> expression calculates the total number of cart additions (event_type = 2) for each product category.</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY ph.product_category</code> clause groups the results by unique product categories from the <code>page_hierarchy</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY ph.product_category</code> clause sorts the results in ascending order based on the product category.</li>
</ul>


  <li><h5>What are the top 3 products by purchases?</h5></li>
  
  ```sql

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query involves multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to analyze product interactions and purchases.</li>
  <li>The first CTE named <code>ProdView</code> calculates the number of views for each product by joining the <code>events</code> and <code>page_hierarchy</code> tables on the <code>page_id</code> column.</li>
  <li>The <code>WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL</code> clause filters out rows with null product IDs.</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause groups the results by <code>visit_id</code>, <code>product_id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, and <code>product_category</code>.</li>
  <li>The second CTE named <code>ProdCart</code> calculates the number of cart additions for each product in a similar manner to the first CTE.</li>
  <li>The third CTE named <code>PurchaseEvents</code> identifies distinct visit IDs with purchase events (event_type = 3).</li>
  <li>The fourth CTE named <code>ProductStats</code> combines data from the previous CTEs to calculate aggregated statistics for each product.</li>
  <li>The main query selects <code>product_name</code>, <code>product_category</code>, and aggregates the <code>views</code>, <code>cart_adds</code>, and <code>purchases</code> based on different conditions.</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause groups the results by <code>product_name</code> and <code>product_category</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>ORDER BY product_name</code> clause sorts the results alphabetically by product name.</li>
</ul>

  
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products <br>
