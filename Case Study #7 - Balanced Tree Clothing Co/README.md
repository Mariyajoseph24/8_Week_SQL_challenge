  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the count of unique transactions from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement includes the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> function to count distinct transaction IDs.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will be the total number of unique transactions present in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT AVG(avg_unique_products) AS average_unique_products_per_transaction
FROM (
    SELECT txn_id, COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS avg_unique_products
    FROM balanced_tree.sales
    GROUP BY txn_id
) AS unique_products_per_transaction;
```

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by first creating a subquery that groups the sales data by <code>txn_id</code> and calculates the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each transaction.</li>
  <li>The outer query then calculates the average of the unique product counts calculated by the subquery using the <code>AVG</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will provide the average number of unique products per transaction across all transactions in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What was the total discount amount for all products?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_25th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_50th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_75th
FROM (
  SELECT
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY txn_id
) AS revenue_cte;
```

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of revenue per transaction from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It does this by first creating a subquery named <code>revenue_cte</code>. This subquery groups the sales data by <code>txn_id</code> and calculates the sum of revenue for each transaction using the formula <code>price * qty</code>.</li>
  <li>The main query then uses the <code>PERCENTILE_CONT</code> function to calculate the specified percentiles (25th, 50th, and 75th) of revenue by ordering the aggregated revenue values within the subquery.</li>
  <li>The calculated percentiles are given the aliases <code>percentile_25th</code>, <code>percentile_50th</code> (median), and <code>percentile_75th</code> respectively.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will provide the specified percentiles of revenue per transaction from the sales data.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
