  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the count of unique transactions from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement includes the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> function to count distinct transaction IDs.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will be the total number of unique transactions present in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?</h5></li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by first creating a subquery that groups the sales data by <code>txn_id</code> and calculates the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each transaction.</li>
  <li>The outer query then calculates the average of the unique product counts calculated by the subquery using the <code>AVG</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will provide the average number of unique products per transaction across all transactions in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What was the total discount amount for all products?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT SUM((price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))) AS total_discount_amount
FROM balanced_tree.sales;

```
  <h6>Answer:</h6>
  <img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/df7e06f7-f44f-4f60-b77a-b62f74aebf26">
 <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the total discount amount for all sales transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by summing up the discounted amounts for each transaction. The discounted amount for a transaction is calculated as <code>(price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the formula, <code>price * qty</code> calculates the total price for the transaction before discount, and <code>price * qty * (discount / 100)</code> calculates the discounted amount based on the discount percentage for that transaction.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM</code> function then aggregates the calculated discounted amounts across all transactions to yield the total discount amount.</li>
  <li>The result of the query provides the total amount saved due to discounts across all sales transactions in the dataset.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the number of unique transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> aggregation function to count the distinct values of the <code>txn_id</code> column, which represents unique transactions.</li>
  <li>The result of the query provides the count of unique transactions present in the sales dataset.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses a subquery to calculate the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each <code>txn_id</code>, which represents the unique products in each transaction.</li>

  <img width="250" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/2671ea54-3d0f-4ca0-89e0-5abee6c095a7">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of revenue per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses a common table expression (CTE) named <code>revenue_cte</code> to calculate the total revenue for each <code>txn_id</code> by summing the product of <code>price</code> and <code>qty</code>.</li>
  <li>The main query then applies the <code>PERCENTILE_CONT</code> function to calculate the desired percentiles (<code>0.25</code>, <code>0.5</code>, and <code>0.75</code>) of the calculated revenue values.</li>
  <li>The results provide insights into the distribution of revenue across transactions, with the median being the 50th percentile.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the average discount value per transaction?</h5></li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average discount per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It calculates the total discount amount for each transaction by multiplying the <code>qty</code>, <code>price</code>, and <code>discount</code> columns and then dividing by 100.</li>
  <li>The main query uses the <code>SUM</code> function to calculate the sum of all the calculated discount amounts and then divides it by the total number of distinct <code>txn_id</code> values using the <code>COUNT</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result is the average discount per transaction, rounded using the <code>ROUND</code> function.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?</h5></li>

    WHEN member = 'f' THEN 'Non-Member'
  END AS member_status,
  COUNT(txn_id) AS transaction_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(txn_id) / (SELECT COUNT(txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales), 2) AS percentage

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query categorizes transactions into two groups based on the <code>member</code> column: 'Member' and 'Non-Member'.</li>
  <li>The <code>CASE</code> statement is used to transform the 't' and 'f' values in the <code>member</code> column into more meaningful labels.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT</code> function calculates the number of transactions for each member status category.</li>
  <li>The main query calculates the percentage of transactions for each member status category out of the total number of transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The subquery <code>(SELECT COUNT(txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales)</code> calculates the total number of transactions in the table.</li>
  <li>The result is the member status ('Member' or 'Non-Member'), the transaction count for each category, and the percentage of transactions represented by each category, rounded to two decimal places using the <code>ROUND</code> function.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?</h5></li>

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the revenue distribution percentage of each segment within its corresponding category based on sales data.</li>
  <li>The query begins by defining a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>category_segment_revenue</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, the query selects columns such as <code>category_id</code>, <code>category_name</code>, <code>segment_id</code>, <code>segment_name</code>, and the total revenue (<code>total_revenue</code>) for each segment within its category.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM</code> function calculates the total revenue by multiplying the price and quantity for each sale, and the results are grouped by <code>category_id</code>, <code>category_name</code>, <code>segment_id</code>, and <code>segment_name</code>.</li>
  <li>The main query selects columns from the <code>category_segment_revenue</code> CTE, including <code>category_id</code>, <code>category_name</code>, <code>segment_id</code>, <code>segment_name</code>, and <code>total_revenue</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>ROUND</code> function is used to calculate the revenue percentage of each segment within its category.</li>
  <li>The percentage is calculated as the total revenue of the segment divided by the total revenue of all segments within the same category, then multiplied by 100.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM(total_revenue)</code> is calculated over a window partitioned by <code>category_id</code>, ensuring that the percentage is calculated for each category separately.</li>
  <li>The calculated revenue percentage is displayed as <code>revenue_percentage</code>.</li>
  <li>The query presents the category-wise revenue distribution for each segment, showing the <code>category_id</code>, <code>category_name</code>, <code>segment_id</code>, <code>segment_name</code>, total revenue, and the revenue percentage.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the percentage split of total revenue by category?</h5></li>

  ```sql
WITH category_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    p.category_id,
    p.category_name,
    SUM(s.price * s.qty) AS total_revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details p ON s.prod_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY 
    p.category_id, p.category_name
)

SELECT 
  cr.category_id,
  cr.category_name,
  cr.total_revenue,
  ROUND(100 * cr.total_revenue / SUM(cr.total_revenue) OVER (), 2) AS revenue_percentage
FROM category_revenue cr;
```
