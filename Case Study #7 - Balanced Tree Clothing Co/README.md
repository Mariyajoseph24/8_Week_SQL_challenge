  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the count of unique transactions from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement includes the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> function to count distinct transaction IDs.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will be the total number of unique transactions present in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT AVG(avg_unique_products) AS average_unique_products_per_transaction
FROM (
    SELECT txn_id, COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS avg_unique_products
    FROM balanced_tree.sales
    GROUP BY txn_id
) AS unique_products_per_transaction;

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by first creating a subquery that groups the sales data by <code>txn_id</code> and calculates the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each transaction.</li>
  <li>The outer query then calculates the average of the unique product counts calculated by the subquery using the <code>AVG</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will provide the average number of unique products per transaction across all transactions in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What was the total discount amount for all products?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT SUM((price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))) AS total_discount_amount
FROM balanced_tree.sales;

```

 <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the total discount amount for all sales transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by summing up the discounted amounts for each transaction. The discounted amount for a transaction is calculated as <code>(price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the formula, <code>price * qty</code> calculates the total price for the transaction before discount, and <code>price * qty * (discount / 100)</code> calculates the discounted amount based on the discount percentage for that transaction.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM</code> function then aggregates the calculated discounted amounts across all transactions to yield the total discount amount.</li>
  <li>The result of the query provides the total amount saved due to discounts across all sales transactions in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
