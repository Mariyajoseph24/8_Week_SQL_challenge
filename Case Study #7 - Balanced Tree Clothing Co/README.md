  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the count of unique transactions from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>SELECT</code> statement includes the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> function to count distinct transaction IDs.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will be the total number of unique transactions present in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT AVG(avg_unique_products) AS average_unique_products_per_transaction
FROM (
    SELECT txn_id, COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS avg_unique_products

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction from the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by first creating a subquery that groups the sales data by <code>txn_id</code> and calculates the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each transaction.</li>
  <li>The outer query then calculates the average of the unique product counts calculated by the subquery using the <code>AVG</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result of the query will provide the average number of unique products per transaction across all transactions in the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What was the total discount amount for all products?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT SUM((price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))) AS total_discount_amount
FROM balanced_tree.sales;

```
  <h6>Answer:</h6>
  <img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/df7e06f7-f44f-4f60-b77a-b62f74aebf26">
 <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the total discount amount for all sales transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It achieves this by summing up the discounted amounts for each transaction. The discounted amount for a transaction is calculated as <code>(price * qty) - (price * qty * (discount / 100))</code>.</li>
  <li>Within the formula, <code>price * qty</code> calculates the total price for the transaction before discount, and <code>price * qty * (discount / 100)</code> calculates the discounted amount based on the discount percentage for that transaction.</li>
  <li>The <code>SUM</code> function then aggregates the calculated discounted amounts across all transactions to yield the total discount amount.</li>
  <li>The result of the query provides the total amount saved due to discounts across all sales transactions in the dataset.</li>
</ul>

  <img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/cc690163-b821-44fc-9ef9-8a746836528d">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the number of unique transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses the <code>COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)</code> aggregation function to count the distinct values of the <code>txn_id</code> column, which represents unique transactions.</li>
  <li>The result of the query provides the count of unique transactions present in the sales dataset.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT AVG(avg_unique_products) AS average_unique_products_per_transaction

    SELECT txn_id, COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS avg_unique_products
    FROM balanced_tree.sales
    GROUP BY txn_id
) AS unique_products_per_transaction;

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average number of unique products per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses a subquery to calculate the count of distinct <code>prod_id</code> values for each <code>txn_id</code>, which represents the unique products in each transaction.</li>
  <li>The outer query then calculates the average of the counts obtained from the subquery, providing the average number of unique products per transaction.</li>
  <li>The result of the query gives insight into the average diversity of products bought per transaction.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_25th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_50th,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS percentile_75th
FROM (
  SELECT
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY txn_id
) AS revenue_cte;
```
  <h6>Answer:</h6>
  <img width="250" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/2671ea54-3d0f-4ca0-89e0-5abee6c095a7">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of revenue per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It uses a common table expression (CTE) named <code>revenue_cte</code> to calculate the total revenue for each <code>txn_id</code> by summing the product of <code>price</code> and <code>qty</code>.</li>
  <li>The main query then applies the <code>PERCENTILE_CONT</code> function to calculate the desired percentiles (<code>0.25</code>, <code>0.5</code>, and <code>0.75</code>) of the calculated revenue values.</li>
  <li>The results provide insights into the distribution of revenue across transactions, with the median being the 50th percentile.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the average discount value per transaction?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(SUM(qty * price * discount/100) / COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id)) AS avg_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
  <h6>Answer:</h6>
  <img width="150" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/Mariyajoseph24/8_Week_SQL_challenge/assets/91487663/87f9c13a-d1ff-44cd-8daf-f492264723fd">
  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the average discount per transaction in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>It calculates the total discount amount for each transaction by multiplying the <code>qty</code>, <code>price</code>, and <code>discount</code> columns and then dividing by 100.</li>
  <li>The main query uses the <code>SUM</code> function to calculate the sum of all the calculated discount amounts and then divides it by the total number of distinct <code>txn_id</code> values using the <code>COUNT</code> function.</li>
  <li>The result is the average discount per transaction, rounded using the <code>ROUND</code> function.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN member = 't' THEN 'Member'
    WHEN member = 'f' THEN 'Non-Member'
  END AS member_status,
  COUNT(txn_id) AS transaction_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(txn_id) / (SELECT COUNT(txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales), 2) AS percentage
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY member_status;
```

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query categorizes transactions into two groups based on the <code>member</code> column: 'Member' and 'Non-Member'.</li>
  <li>The <code>CASE</code> statement is used to transform the 't' and 'f' values in the <code>member</code> column into more meaningful labels.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT</code> function calculates the number of transactions for each member status category.</li>
  <li>The main query calculates the percentage of transactions for each member status category out of the total number of transactions in the <code>balanced_tree.sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The subquery <code>(SELECT COUNT(txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales)</code> calculates the total number of transactions in the table.</li>
  <li>The result is the member status ('Member' or 'Non-Member'), the transaction count for each category, and the percentage of transactions represented by each category, rounded to two decimal places using the <code>ROUND</code> function.</li>
</ul>

  
  <li><h5>What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?</h5></li>

  ```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN member = 't' THEN 'Member'
    WHEN member = 'f' THEN 'Non-Member'
  END AS member_status,
  ROUND(AVG(price * qty), 2) AS avg_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY member_status;

  <ul>
  <li>The SQL query categorizes transactions into two groups based on the <code>member</code> column: 'Member' and 'Non-Member'.</li>
  <li>The <code>CASE</code> statement is used to transform the 't' and 'f' values in the <code>member</code> column into more meaningful labels.</li>
  <li>The <code>ROUND</code> function calculates the average revenue for each member status category by multiplying the <code>price</code> and <code>qty</code> columns and then rounding the result to two decimal places.</li>
  <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause groups the results by the transformed member status.</li>
  <li>The result displays the member status ('Member' or 'Non-Member') and the average revenue for each category.</li>
