<p>This repository serves as a comprehensive solution for the #8WeekSQLChallenge, encompassing eight distinct case studies.The repository is a testament to my prowess in SQL, as it demonstrates my adeptness in solving diverse SQL challenges and showcases my expertise in query composition and problem-solving. These case studies cover a wide array of topics, including ranking, common table expressions (CTEs), datetime functions, text manipulation, aggregation, NULL handling, and more.<br>

This repository reflects the culmination of my journey through various SQL challenges. Each case study presents a unique problem-solving scenario that required me to apply a range of SQL techniques such as CTEs, case statements, date functions, and complex aggregations. As a result, I have honed my skills in SQL query crafting, data manipulation, and analysis.<br>
